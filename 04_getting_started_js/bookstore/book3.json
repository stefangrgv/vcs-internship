Next Saturday, in fact. Just before dinner.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So the armies of Good and Evil are amassing, Atlantis is rising, frogs are falling, tempers are flaring. Everything appears to be going according to Divine Plan. Except a somewhat fussy angel and a fast-living demon—both of whom have lived amongst Earth&apos;s mortals since The Beginning and have grown rather fond of the lifestyle—are not actually looking forward to the coming Rapture.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And someone seems to have misplaced the Antichrist . . .&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

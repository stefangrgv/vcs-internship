    "description": "&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Witch&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;&#35;40;the world&apos;s only&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;completely&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;accurate book of prophecies, written in 1655, before she exploded&amp;&#35;41;, the world will end on a Saturday. Next Saturday, in fact. Just before dinner.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So the armies of Good and Evil are amassing, Atlantis is rising, frogs are falling, tempers are flaring. Everything appears to be going according to Divine Plan. Except a somewhat fussy angel and a fast-living demon—both of whom have lived amongst Earth&apos;s mortals since The Beginning and have grown rather fond of the lifestyle—are not actually looking forward to the coming Rapture.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And someone seems to have misplaced the Antichrist . . .&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",
